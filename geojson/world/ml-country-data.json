More recent polls show a large majority remain opposed to independence. The authorities are co-operating with a global OECD initiative aimed at ending \"harmful\" practices that have plagued the offshore financial industry and given the territory its reputation as a tax haven.

It has held free and fair democratic elections since independence.\r\n<br><br>Geographically the country is flat and up to 70% of Botswana is covered by the Kalahari Desert. It is bordered by South Africa to the south and southeast, Namibia to the west and north, and Zimbabwe to the northeast. It meets Zambia at a single point.\r\nBotswana is one of Africa's most stable countries, is the continent's longest continuous multi-party democracy. It is relatively free of corruption and has a good human rights record.\r\nIt is also the world's largest producer of diamonds and the trade has transformed it into a middle-income nation.\r\n<br><br>Botswana protects some of Africa's largest areas of wilderness. It is sparsely populated, because it is so dry. The Kalahari desert, home to a dwindling band of Bushman hunter-gatherers, makes up much of the territory and most areas are too arid to sustain any agriculture other than cattle. It is one of the fastest growing economies in the world.<br><br>In terms of politics controversy surrounds the forced relocation of San Bushmen from their traditional hunting grounds. The ruling party won all 10 elections since the country gained independence in 1966. Recent economic growth has been high by African standards. The government sees diversification out of diamonds as a priority. Botswana plays an active role in Southern African development community (SADC) economic grouping and has supplied troops for intervention in other parts of Africa.&nbsp;",

The discovery of major offshore oil reserves could propel the country into the top league of oil-exporting nations. <br /><br />The exploitation of the Amazon rainforest, much of which is in Brazil, has been a major international worry, since the wilderness is a vital regulator of the climate. It is also an important reservoir of plant and animal life. A drive to move settlers to the Amazon region during military rule in the 1970s caused considerable damage to vast areas of rainforest.

With a total landmass of 181,035 square kilometres (69,898 sq mi), it is bordered by Thailand to the northwest, Laos to the northeast, Vietnam to the east, and the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>The fate of Cambodia shocked the world when the communist Khmer Rouge, under their leader Pol Pot seized power in 1975 after years of guerrilla warfare. During the next three years around 1.7 million people died, some from torture and execuation, others from starvation and exhaustion.&nbsp;<br><br>Cambodia is one of the poorest countries in the world and relies heavily on aid. Rebuilding from decades of civil war, Cambodia has seen rapid progress in the economical and human resource areas. Strong textiles, agriculture, construction, garments, and tourism sectors led to foreign investments and international trade. In 2005, oil and natural gas deposits were found beneath Cambodia's territorial waters, and once commercial extraction begins in 2011, the oil revenues could profoundly affect Cambodia's economy.",

It is bordered by Nigeria to the west; Chad to the northeast; the Central African Republic to the east; and Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Republic of the Congo to the south. Cameroon's coastline lies on the Bight of Bonny, part of the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n<br><br>The modern state of Cameroon was created in 1961 by the unification of two former colonies, one British and one French.\r\nSince then it has struggled from one-party rule to a multi-party system in which the freedom of expression is severely limited.\r\nCameroon began its independence with a bloody insurrection which was suppressed only with the help of French forces.\r\nThere followed 20 years of repressive government under President Ahmadou Ahidjo. Nonetheless, Cameroon saw investment in agriculture, education, health care and transport.\r\n<br><br>In 1982 Mr Ahidjo was succeeded by his prime minister, Paul Biya. Faced with popular discontent, Mr Biya allowed multi-party presidential elections in 1992, which he won.\r\nIn 1994 and 1996 Cameroon and Nigeria fought over the disputed, oil-rich Bakassi peninsula. Nigeria withdrew its troops from the area in 2006 in line with an international court ruling which awarded sovereignty to Cameroon. In November 2007 the Nigerian senate passed a motion declaring as illegal the Nigeria-Cameroon agreement for the Bakassi Peninsula to be handed over to Cameroon. Cameroon has one of the highest literacy rates in Africa. However, the country's progress is hampered by a level of corruption that is among the highest in the world.",

Seat belt use is mandatory for all passengers, and child car seats must be used by children under 20 Kg (40 pounds). Signs and symbols are very similar to those used in most countries around the world, so they display symbols instead of text. In Quebec, most of the signs are in French only, so in certain areas knowledge of French can be important. Talking on mobile phones while driving in Canada is illegal. Driving while impaired is a criminal offence in Canada. Penalties are heavy, and any prior conviction (no matter how old or how minor the infraction) is grounds for exclusion from Canada. Always keep dipped headlights on during \nSigns alerting drivers to beware of certain wildlife that roam nearby may be seen on some roads.

The money that they send home brings in much-needed foreign currency. From the mid-1990s, droughts cut the islands' grain crop by 80%, and in 2002 the government appealed for international food aid after the harvest failed.\r\nNonetheless, Cape Verde enjoys a per capita income that is higher than that of many continental African nations. It has sought closer economic ties with the US, EU and Portugal. In 2008 Cape Verde became only the second country after Botswana to be promoted by the United Nations out of the ranks of the 50 least developed countries. In recent years it has seen economic growth averaging 6%, the construction of three international airports and hundreds of kilometres of roads.",

To the west, north, and south, the West Bank shares borders with the state of Israel. To the east, across the Jordan River, lies the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The West Bank also contains a significant coastline along the western bank of the Dead Sea. <br><br>Since 1967, most of the West Bank has been under Israeli military occupation and is referred to as Judea and Samaria Area by Israel. A smaller part of the West Bank is administered by the Israeli civilian authorities as part of Jerusalem District.\r\n\r\nFor 400 years immediately prior to the First World War, the area now known as the West Bank was under Ottoman rule as part of the province of Syria. At the 1920 San Remo conference, the victorious Allied powers (UK, US) allocated the area to the British Mandate of Palestine. Following World War II, United Nations passed the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181 (II) Future Government of Palestine which aimed to establish a two-state solution within Palestine. The Resolution designated the territory described as \"Samaria and Judea\" (now known as the \"West Bank\") as part of the proposed Arab state, but following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War this area was captured by Trans-Jordan (renamed Jordan in 1949). <br><br>The name \"West Bank\" was proposed by the Jordanian authorities to describe the area west of Jordan River. The 1949 Armistice Agreements defined its interim boundary. \r\n\r\nFrom 1948 until 1967, the area was under Jordanian rule, and Jordan did not officially relinquish its claim to the area until 1988, ceding its territorial claims to the PLO and eventually stripping West Bank Palestinians of Jordanian citizenship. Jordan's claim was never formally recognised by the international community, with the exception of the United Kingdom. The West Bank was occupied by Israel during the Six-Day War in June, 1967. With the exception of East Jerusalem and the former Israeli-Jordanian no man's land, the West Bank was not annexed by Israel but remained under Israeli military control. Most of the residents are Arabs, although a large number of Israeli settlements have been built in the region since 1967. <br><br>The settlements that Israel has built in the West Bank are home to around 400,000 people and are deemed to be illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.\r\n\r\nIsrael evacuated its settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005 and withdrew its forces, ending almost four decades of military occupation. However, after the militant Islamic group Hamas seized control of Gaza in June 2007, Israel intensified its economic blockade of the Strip.\r\n\r\nIn 1979 Egypt and Israel signed a peace agreement, but it wasn't until the early 1990s, after years of an uprising known as the intifada, that a peace process began with the Palestinians. Despite the hand over of Gaza and parts of the West Bank to Palestinian control, a \"final status\" agreement has yet to be reached. The main stumbling blocks include the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements.",

It has been relatively free of the coups and arbitrary governments that have blighted the continent.\r\nThe exception was the 17-year rule of General Augusto Pinochet, whose 1973 coup was one of the bloodiest in 20th-century Latin America and whose dictatorship left more than 3,000 people dead and missing.\r\n<br><br>Chile has steadily come to terms with the legacy of General Pinochet's rule. The former military ruler was questioned over the Chilean role in the killing of dissidents by various South American governments in the 1970s and 1980s, and he denied allegations until his death in December 2006. The authoritarian Pinochet-era constitution has been revised and the judicial system overhauled. The country had Latin America's fastest-growing economy in the 1990s and has weathered recent regional economic instability.<br><br>The 2010 election of conservative President Pinera ended two decades of centre-left government. Chile has one of Latin America's strongest economies and high world prices for its copper have swollen state coffers. Chile is a key player in its regions, but it has long-running territorial disputes with Peru and Bolivia, the latter over access to the Pacific Ocean.",

However, Wallis and Futuna is not part of, nor even contiguous with, French Polynesia. Wallis and Futuna is located at the very opposite western end of Polynesia.\r\n\r\nIt has an estimated population of about 15,000. Mata-Utu is the capital and biggest city. <br><br>The territory is made up of three main volcanic tropical islands along with a number of tiny islets, and is split into two island groups that lie about 260 km apart, namely Wallis Islands (Uvea) in the north east, and Hoorn Islands (Futuna Islands) in the south west, including Futuna Island proper and the mostly uninhabited Alofi Island.\r\n\r\n<br><br>Since 2003 Wallis and Futuna has been a French overseas collectivity. Between 1961 and 2003, it had the status of a French overseas territory.\r\n\r\nThe territory is divided into three traditional kingdoms: Uvea, on the island of Wallis, Sigave, on the western part of the island of Futuna, and Alo, on the island of Alofi and on the eastern part of the island of Futuna.\r\n\r\nThe head of state is President of France and represented by High Administrator. The Council of the Territory consists of three kings (monarchs of the three pre-colonial kingdoms) and three members appointed by the high administrator on the advice of the Territorial Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe legislative branch consists of the unicameral Territorial Assembly of 20 seats; the members are elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms. Wallis and Futuna elects one senator to the French Senate and one deputy to the French National Assembly.\r\n\r\nJustice is generally administered under French law by a tribunal of first instance in Mata-Utu, but the three traditional kingdoms administer justice according to customary law (only for non-criminal cases). The court of appeal is in Nouma, New Caledonia.\r\n\r\nThe territory participates in the Franc Zone, and as a permanent member of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community and as an observer of the Pacific Islands Forum.",

The terrain in the west is rugged and elevated, with the Himalayas and the Tian Shan mountain ranges forming China's natural borders with India, Nepal and Central Asia. In contrast, mainland China's eastern seaboard is low-lying and has a 14,500-kilometre (9,000 mi) long coastline (the 11th longest in the world), bounded on the southeast by the South China Sea and on the east by the East China Sea, beyond which lie the Taiwan, Korea, and Japan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>After stagnating for more than two decades under the rigid authoritarianism of early communist rule under its late leader, Chairman Mao, China now has the world's fastest-growing economy and is undergoing what has been described as a second industrial revolution.\r\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC) was founded in 1949 after the Communist Party defeated the previously dominant nationalist Kuomintang in a civil war. The Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan, creating two rival Chinese states - the PRC on the mainland and the Republic of China based on Taiwan.\r\nBeijing says the island of Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory that must be reunited with the mainland. The claim has in the past led to tension and threats of invasion, but since 2008 the two governments have moved towards a more cooperative atmosphere.\r\nThe rate of economic change hasn't been matched by political reform, with the Communist Party - the world's biggest political party - retaining its monopoly on power and maintaining strict control over the people.

      "countryOverview": "The Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, commonly known as East Timor is a state in Southeast Asia. It comprises the eastern half of the island of Timor, the nearby islands of Atauro and Jaco, and Oecusse, an exclave on the northwestern side of the island, within Indonesian West Timor. The small country of 15,410 km (5,400 sq mi) is located about 640 km (400 mi) northwest of Darwin, Australia.\r\n<br><br>East Timor has a lower-middle-income economy and it continues to suffer the effects of the independence struggle against Indonesia. This struggle left thousands of civilians homeless and damaged the infrastructure of the country, most of which has not be repaired.<br><br>East Timor's road to independence was achieved on 20 May 2002 but it was long and traumatic.\r\nThe people of the first new nation of the century suffered some of the worst atrocities of modern times.\r\nAn independent report commissioned by the UN transitional administration in East Timor said that at least 100,000 Timorese died as a result of Indonesia's 25-year occupation, which ended in 1999.\r\n\r\nPortugal began to establish colonial control over Timor in the 16th century, when the island was divided into small states. The Netherlands later colonised the west of the island, which was formally partitioned between the two imperial powers in 1916.\r\nPortugal invested little in Timor, and withdrew unilaterally in 1975 after deciding to dissolve its colonial empire. Indonesia invaded within days of the Timorese declaration of independence, and used force to crush popular resistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>Major world and regional powers did little to counter Indonesian rule, which was not recognised by the UN. Falintil guerrillas fought for independence, and their cause captured world attention in 1991 when Indonesian forces opened fire on a memorial procession in the capital, Dili, killing at least 250 people.\r\nInternational pressure increased and finally persuaded Indonesia to allow an independence referendum in 1999, during which a pro-Indonesian militia, apparently with Indonesian army support, tried in vain to use terror to discourage voters. When the referendum showed overwhelming support for independence, the militia went on the rampage, murdering hundreds and reducing towns to ruins. An international peacekeeping force halted the mayhem and paved the way for a United Nations mission which helped reconstruct East Timor.\r\nThe rebuilding of East Timor has been one of the UN's biggest success stories. The UN Mission of Support in East Timor, Unmiset, wound up in May 2005. <br><br>Security has been precarious. An outbreak of gang violence in 2006 prompted the UN Security Council to set up a new peacekeeping force, Unmit. The UN said poverty and unemployment had exacerbated the unrest.\r\n\r\nAs one of Asia's poorest nations, East Timor will rely on outside help for many years. The infrastructure is poor and the country is drought-prone. However, vast offshore oil and gas fields in the Timor Sea hold much potential. East Timor and Australia have agreed to share revenues from the reserves. As a part of the deal, a decision on the disputed maritime border in the area was deferred. East Timor is trying to foster national reconciliation. Indonesia and East Timor set up bodies to bring the perpetrators of the 1999 violence to justice. However a 2005 UN report concluded that the systems had failed to deliver. The Indonesian special court acquitted most of the 18 indicted suspects.",

The atolls lie north of the Samoan Islands, east of Tuvalu, south of the Phoenix Islands, southwest of the more distant Line Islands (both island groups belonging to Kiribati) and northwest of the Cook Islands.&nbsp;There is no airport and it takes more than a day at sea to reach its southern neighbour, Samoa.<br><br>The United Nations General Assembly designated Tokelau a Non-Self-Governing Territory. Until 1976 the official name was Tokelau Islands. Tokelau is sometimes referred to by the older, colonial name of The Union Islands. &nbsp;Tokelau's electorate, numbering around 600, have rejected self-rule in two separate referendums held in 2006 and 2007.\r\n<br><br>Most of the 1,500 islanders live by subsistence farming. Thousands have chosen to leave, usually for New Zealand or Samoa. The latter has a similar culture and language.\r\n\r\nThe UN has earmarked Tokelau as one of a number of territories where it wants to encourage greater independence. However, Tokelauans voted in February 2006 to retain their colonial status, rather than to take on greater autonomy. Tokelau has few resources apart from its fishing grounds, but makes some money from the sale of fishing rights and the use of its internet domain. New Zealand provides around 80% of the territory's budget and has tried to allay fears that it will abandon the atolls should Tokelau become autonomous.\r\nLike other low-lying Pacific territories, Tokelau is said to be at risk from rising sea levels. It is also vulnerable to tropical cyclones.\r\n<br><br>In July 2009 Tokelau announced its ambition to become completely energy self-sufficient in a year's time. Tokelau's Ulu (leader), said that \"we'll try to beat every nation in the world to become the first country to be energy renewable, completely run by solar power and a little bit of coconut oil.\"",

In 2002 Turks and Caicos was removed from a list of countries and territories considered to be uncooperative tax havens by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which seeks to end harmful tax practices around the globe.\r\nHowever, by 2009 it remained on the OECD's grey list of those who say they will comply with rules on sharing tax information but have yet to act.\r\n<br><br>Upmarket tourism is centred on Providenciales, or Provo. Coral reefs and 200 miles of beaches draw holidaymakers and divers, mostly from the US and Canada. But over-development is a concern; some fragile eco-systems, including wetlands and lagoons, are designated as protected areas. There is little agriculture, though the territory is home to the world's only conch farm. The molluscs are exported. \r\n\r\nIndependence moves in the 1980s ended when a pro-dependency government was elected. Islanders have British citizenship. The territory enjoys strong links with Canada and politicians have occasionally mooted a political and economic union. Once a dependency of Jamaica, the Turks and Caicos Islands became a crown colony upon Jamaican independence in 1962.&nbsp;",

Colombia is bordered to the east by Venezuela and Brazil to the south by Ecuador and Peru; to the north by the Caribbean Sea; to the northwest by Panama; and to the west by the Pacific Ocean. Colombia also shares maritime borders with Venezuela, Jamaica, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. It is the only South American country having coasts in the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. It is a middle power and has the fourth largest economy in Latin America. Colombia is famous for producing coffee, coal, oil, flowers and emeralds.&nbsp;<br /><br />With a population of over 46 million people, Colombia has the 29th largest population in the world and the second largest in South America, after Brazil. Colombia has the third largest population of any Spanish-speaking country in the world, after Mexico and Spain. <br /><br />Since the 1960's, government forces, left-wing insurgents and right-wing paramilitaries have been engaged in the continent's longest-running armed conflict. Fuelled by the cocaine trade, this escalated dramatically in the 1980's. Nevertheless, in the 2000's the violence has decreased significantly. Many paramilitary groups have demobilized as part of a controversial peace process with the government, and the guerrillas have lost control in many areas where they once dominated. Furthermore, the strength of these left-wing insurgent groups has decreased dramatically in recent periods. For example, on the 27th December 2013 Colombian military forces killed dozens of members, including a regional commander, of the FARC guerrilla group in the central province of Meta. Colombian Air Force planes are reported to have located a FARC camp situated within the province and subsequentlyneutralized it.&nbsp;</p>",

A rival militia group, the Malaitan Eagle Force, staged a coup in June 2000 and forced the then prime minister to resign, saying he had failed to deal with th crisis that left 100 people dead.&nbsp;<br><br>It must be stated, that the country appears to have settled since then and Australia currently leads a mission which aims to ensure security. Australian forces arrived in 2003 when violence between ethnic militias threatened to spiral into anarchy.&nbsp;",

It also borders the Central African Republic and Sudan to the north; Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi in the east; Zambia and Angola to the south; the Atlantic Ocean to the west; and is separated from Tanzania by Lake Tanganyika in the east. The country has access to the ocean through a 40-kilometre (25 mi) stretch of Atlantic coastline at Muanda and the roughly 9 km wide mouth of the Congo River which opens into the Gulf of Guinea.\r\n<br><br>The Democratic Republic of the Congo was formerly, in chronological order, the Congo Free State, Belgian Congo, Congo-Lopoldville, Congo-Kinshasa, and Zaire. Though it is located in the Central African UN subregion, the nation is economically and regionally affiliated with Southern Africa as a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).\r\nThis has left it in the grip of a humanitarian crisis. The five-year conflict pitted government forces, supported by Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe, against rebels backed by Uganda and Rwanda. Despite a peace deal and the formation of a transitional government in 2003, people in the east of the country remain in terror of marauding militia and the army.\r\n<br><br>The war claimed an estimated three million lives, either as a direct result of fighting or because of disease and malnutrition. It has been called possibly the worst emergency to unfold in Africa in recent decades. The war had an economic as well as a political side.

      "countryOverview": "Russia is officially known as both Russia and the Russian Federation and is a country in northern Eurasia. It is a federal semi-presidential republic, comprising 83 federal subjects. From northwest to southeast, Russia shares borders with Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland (both via Kaliningrad Oblast), Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, the People's Republic of China, Mongolia, and North Korea. It also has maritime borders with Japan by the Sea of Okhotsk, and the United States by the Bering Strait. <br><br>Russia is the largest country in the world, covering more than one eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area. Russia is also the ninth most populous nation with 143 million people. It extends across the whole of northern Asia and 40% of Europe, spanning nine time zones and incorporating a wide range of environments and landforms. Russia has the world's largest reserves of mineral and energy resources. It has the world's largest forest reserves and its lakes contain approximately one-quarter of the world's fresh water.\r\n<br><br>Following the Russian Revolution, Russia became the largest and leading constituent of the Soviet Union, the world's first constitutionally socialist state and a recognized superpower, that played a decisive role in the Allied victory in World War II. The Soviet era saw some of the greatest technology achievements of the 20th century, such as the world's first human spaceflight. The Russian Federation was founded following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, but is recognized as the continuing legal personality of the Soviet state. It is one of the five recognized nuclear weapons states and possesses the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. <br><br>Russia is a great power and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a member of the G8, G20, the Council of Europe and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.\r\nDuring Mr Putin's presidency Russia's booming economy and assertive foreign policy bolstered national pride. In particular, Russia promoted its perceived interests in former Soviet states more openly, even at the cost of antagonising the West.\r\n The tensest moment came in August 2008, when a protracted row over two breakaway regions of Georgia escalated into a military conflict between Russia and Georgia. Russia sent troops into Georgia and declared that it was recognising the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, sparking angry reactions in the West and fears of a new Cold War.\r\nAt the same time, Moscow threatened to counter plans by the US Bush administration to develop an anti-missile system in Eastern Europe with its own missiles in Kaliningrad Region on Poland's borders. President Obama later withdrew the plan, in a move seen in Russian official circles as a vindication of the assertive foreign policy.\r\nAnother source of irritation between Russia and the US is Moscow's role in Iran's nuclear energy programme. Russia agreed in 2005 to supply fuel for Iran's Bushehr nuclear reactor and has been reluctant to support the imposition of UN sanctions on Iran. A gradual warming in relations between Russia and the US early in 2010 culminated in the signing of a new nuclear arms treaty designed to replace the expired Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start) of 1991.\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;Moscow believes any loosening of its grip on Chechnya would result in the whole of the North Caucasus falling to anarchy or Islamic militancy. Human rights groups at home and abroad have accused Russian forces in Chechnya of widespread abuses against the public. Since the 11 September attacks on the US Moscow has tried to present its campaign as part of the global war against terrorism.\r\nIn a sign of growing confidence that peace might be returning, the Russian authorities called a formal end to the military operation against the rebels in 2009. Sporadic violence continues, however, with a major suicide bomb blast in September 2010 reigniting the debate about the efficacy of the counter-terror campaign.",

As such, residents of Norfolk Island are not represented in the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia, making them the only group of residents of an Australian state or territory not represented there.\r\n<br><br>In 2006, a formal review process took place, in which the Australian government considered revising this model of government. The review was completed on 20 December 2006, when it was decided that there would be no changes in the governance of Norfolk Island. Financial problems and a reduction in tourism led to Norfolk Island's administration appealing to the Australian federal government for assistance in 2010. As a result Islanders will pay income tax for the first time but will be eligible for greater welfare benefits.",

      "countryOverview": "Cyprus is officially the Republic of Cyprus and is a Eurasian island country in the Eastern Mediterranean, east of Greece, south of Turkey, west of Syria and north of Egypt. It is the third largest island in the Mediterranean Sea and one of its most popular tourist destinations. <br><br>An advanced, high-income economy with a very high Human Development Index, the Republic of Cyprus was a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement until it joined the European Union on 1 May 2004.\r\n\r\nCyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded the north in response to a military coup on the island which was backed by the Athens government. A \"Green Line\" - dividing the two parts from Morphou through Nicosia to Famagusta - is patrolled by United Nations troops. <br><br>The UN drew up the Green Line as a ceasefire demarcation line in 1963 after intervening to end communal tension. It became impassable after the Turkish invasion of 1974, except for designated crossing points. In 1983 the Turkish-held area declared itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The status of Northern Cyprus as a separate entity is recognised only by Turkey, which keeps around 30,000 troops in the north of the island. The prospect of EU enlargement concentrated minds in the search for a settlement. UN-sponsored negotiations continued throughout 2002 and a peace plan was tabled. <br><br>Soon afterwards the EU invited Cyprus to become a member. But hopes that the island could join united were dashed when leaders of the Turkish and Greek communities failed to agree to the UN plan by the March 2003 deadline. In the months that followed travel restrictions were eased, enabling people to cross the border for the first time in nearly 30 years, raising hopes that progress might be on the way. As EU entry approached, a revised UN reunification plan was put to both communities in twin referendums in April 2004. The plan was endorsed by Turkish Cypriots - though not by their then leader Rauf Denktash - but overwhelmingly rejected by Greek Cypriots. Because both sides had to approve the proposals, the island remained divided as it joined the EU in May. EU laws and benefits apply only to the Greek Cypriot community.",

Mauritius Island is part of the Mascarene Islands, with the French island of Reunion 200 km (120 mi) to the southwest and the island of Rodrigues 570 km (350 mi) to the north-east. Mauritius's area is 2040 km2; its capital city is Port Louis.\r\nIt became a republic in 1992. <br><br>Mauritius is a parliamentary republic and is a member of the Southern African Development Community, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, the African Union, La Francophonie and the Commonwealth of Nations. Mauritius has an upper middle income economy.\r\nThe main languages spoken in Mauritius are Mauritian Creole, French and English. English is the only official language but the lingua franca is Mauritian Creole and the newspapers and television programmes are usually in French. The country is composed of several ethnicities, including Asian, African, Chinese and French. \r\n<br><br>Once reliant on sugar as its main crop export, Mauritius was hit by the removal of European trade preferences but has successfully diversified into textiles, upmarket tourism, banking and business out sourcing. The strategy helped the island's economy weather the world financial crisis of 2008-9 better than expected.<br><br>Navin Ramgoolam became premier in July 2005, having previously holding the post from 1995 to 2000. Political stability and efforts to diversify have helped Mauritius become one of Africa's most prosperous economies.&nbsp;",

Speed limits are 50 km/h in towns and on highways 120 km/h. Headlights must be on at all times during winter and until the change of time for summer.  Drivers should be aware that there is a zero-tolerance policy in the Czech Republic for drivers under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.  It is a requirement under Czech law that all private cars, including those of foreign visitors, carry a fluorescent green high visibility safety jacket, a first aid kit, a spare pair of prescription glasses (if necessary) - kept in the glove compartment, a warning triangle and a complete set of spare bulbs.",

The country is bordered by Poland to the northeast, Slovakia to the east, Austria to the south, and Germany to the west and northwest. The Czech Republic has been a member of NATO since 1999 and of the European Union since 2004. <br><br>The Czech Republic is also a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). As an OSCE participating state, the Czech Republic's international commitments are subject to monitoring under the mandate of the U.S. Helsinki Commission. From 1 January 2009 to 30 June 2009, the Czech Republic held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.\r\nThe independent Republic of Czechoslovakia was formed in 1918, following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire after World War I. <br><br>After the Munich Agreement (signed by Nazi Germany, France, Britain and Italy), Polish annexation of Zaolzie and German occupation of Czechoslovakia and the consequent disillusion with the Western response and gratitude for the liberation of the major portion of Czechoslovakia by the Red Army, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia won plurality (38%) in the 1946 elections.\r\nIn a 1948 Czechoslovakia became a communist-ruled state. In 1968, the increasing dissatisfaction culminated in attempts to reform the communist regime. The events, known as the Prague Spring of 1968, ended with an invasion by the armies of the Warsaw Pact countries (with the exception of Romania); the troops remained in the country until the 1989 Velvet Revolution, when the communist regime collapsed. <br><br>On 1 January 1993, Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved into its constituent states, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\r\nThe Czech Republic is a pluralist multi-party parliamentary representative democracy. The Czech Republic made economic reforms such as fast privatizations. \r\nIn addition to its developed industrial economy, the Czech Republic now attracts tourists to some of the finest Baroque, Art Nouveau and Cubist buildings in Europe.",

Liberia has a hot equatorial climate, with significant rainfall during the May to October rainy season and harsh harmattan winds the remainder of the year. Liberia covers an area of 111,369 km2 (43,000 sq mi) and is home to about 3.7 million people. English is the official language, while over 30 indigenous languages are spoken within the country.\r\nLiberia is one of only two modern countries in Sub-Saharan Africa without roots in the European Scramble for Africa. <br><br>Beginning in 1820, the region was colonized by freed American slaves with the help of the American Colonization Society, a private organisation that believed ex-slaves would have greater freedom and equality in Africa. Slaves freed from slave ships were also sent there instead of being repatriated to their countries of origin. In 1847, these colonists founded the Republic of Liberia, establishing a government modelled on that of the United States and naming the capital city Monrovia after James Monroe, the fifth president of the United States and a prominent supporter of the colonization. The colonists, known as Americo-Liberians, monopolized the political and economic sectors of the country despite comprising only a small percentage of the largely indigenous population.\r\n<br><br>The country began to modernize in the 1940's following investment by the United States during World War II and economic liberalisation under President William Tubman. Liberia was a founding member of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity. A military coup overthrew the Americo-Liberian establishment in 1980, marking the beginning of political and economic instability and two successive civil wars that left approximately 250,000 people dead and devastated the country's economy. Anti-government fighting broke out in the north in 1999. <br><br>The president, Mr Taylor, accused Guinea of supporting the rebellion. Meanwhile Ghana, Nigeria and others accused Mr Taylor of backing rebels in Sierra Leone.\r\nA 2003 peace deal led to democratic elections in 2005. Today, Liberia is recovering from the lingering effects of the civil war and related economic dislocation, with about 85% of the population living below the international poverty line.\r\nThe capital remains without mains electricity and running water. Corruption is rife and unemployment and illiteracy are endemic.\r\nThe UN maintains some 15,000 soldiers in Liberia. It is one of the organisation's most expensive peacekeeping operations.",

The country has an estimated population of around 15.4m. Its capital is Lilongwe, the second largest city is Blantyre and the third largest city is Mzuzu. <br><br>The name Malawi comes from the Maravi, an old name of the Nyanja people that inhabit the area. The country is also nicknamed, \"The Warm Heart of Africa\".\r\nMalawi was first settled during the 10th century and remained under native rule until 1891 when it was colonized by the British, who ruled the country until 1964. Upon gaining independence it became a single-party state under the presidency of Hastings Banda, who remained president until 1994, when he was ousted from power. Malawi has a democratic, multi-party government. Malawi has a small military force that includes an army, a navy and an air wing. Malawi's foreign policy is pro-Western and includes positive diplomatic relations with most countries and participation in several international organizations.\r\n<br><br>Malawi is among the world's least developed countries. The economy is heavily based in agriculture, with a largely rural population. The Malawian government depends heavily on outside aid to meet development needs, although this need (and the aid offered) has decreased since 2000. The Malawian government faces challenges in building and expanding the economy, improving education, health care, environmental protection, and becoming financially independent. Malawi has several programs developed since 2005 that focus on these issues, and the country's outlook appears to be improving, with improvements in economic growth, education and healthcare seen in 2007 and 2008.<br><br>Malawi has a low life expectancy and high infant mortality. There is a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, which is a drain on the labour force and government expenditures, and is expected to have a significant impact on gross domestic product (GDP) by 2010. There is a diverse population of native peoples, Asians and Europeans, with several languages spoken and an array of religious beliefs. Although there was tribal conflict in the past, by 2008 it had diminished considerably and the concept of a Malawian nationality had begun to form. Malawi has a culture combining native and colonial aspects, including sports, art, dance and music.",

The national bird of Grenada is the critically endangered Grenada Dove.\r\n<br><br>Grenada made the world headlines in 1983 when a split in the governing left-wing party led to the overthrow and execution of the country's charismatic leader, Maurice Bishop, and provided the pretext for a US invasion of the islands. Set against the background of Grenada's hitherto peaceful post-independence history, the event highlighted the country's contradictory character.\r\n\r\nIt also boasts beautiful scenery, with picturesque and fertile valleys, rainforests, fast-flowing streams, hot springs, mountain lakes, a tropical climate and excellent beaches.\r\n<br><br>Although Grenada has one of the fastest-growing economies in the Caribbean, poverty is widespread. Growth in investment and tourism, and a construction boom, have helped to reduce unemployment.\r\nThe country was dealt a serious blow in 2004 when Hurricane Ivan swept through killing dozens of people, damaging 90% of the island's buildings and devastating the nutmeg crop. Tourism has generated its own problems, in the form of threats to the rainforest and beach erosion caused by resort projects.",

Christopher Columbus named the island Santa Maria de Guadalupe in 1493 after the Virgin Mary, venerated in the Spanish town of Guadalupe, in Extremadura.\r\n<br><br>Guadeloupe's economy is kept afloat by public salaries and credits from Paris. Unemployment has been a long-running malaise, although its effects are tempered by France's generous social security system.\r\nAgriculture revolves around sugar cane and bananas; the latter is troubled by regional competition and the phasing out of preferential European quotas. Tourism is important. Visitors, most of them from France, are drawn to Guadeloupe's resorts, beaches, waterfalls and forests and the territory is a port of call for cruise ships.\r\n<br><br>Guadeloupe is prone to earthquakes and hurricanes. Mount Soufriere, Basse-Terre's volcano, last erupted in the 1970's.\r\nAlthough support for the status quo is strong, a campaign for secession from France flared in the 1980's when pro-independence groups bombed hotels and government buildings. Discontent at the rising cost of living led to violent protests early in 2009, and France sent in troops when rioters killed a trade union official. The French government raised wages for the low-paid, a key demand of the protestors, who ended a general strike in March 2009.",

France conducted 41 atmospheric tests on the Mururoa atoll and neighbouring Fangataufa from 1966. In 1975, under international pressure, it switched to underground tests. Ending a three year moratorium, French President Jacques Chirac said testing would resume in 1995. The move provoked international anger and protests in Papeete turned violent. Six of the eight planned tests were carried out, the last one in January 1996. At the end of the programme Paris agreed to a 10-year compensation package. In 1995 the UN's nuclear watchdog concluded that radiation levels around the atolls posed no threat. <br><br>In 1999 Paris admitted that fractures had been discovered in the coral cone at the sites. The atolls continue to be monitored. In March 2009, the French government enacted legislation to allow compensation for former workers at France's nuclear weapons test sites.

President Jammeh wants to turn The Gambia into an oil-producing state. He says this could usher in a \"new future\". However, the country has yet to strike crude oil. <br><br>Tourism is an important source of foreign exchange, as is the money sent home by Gambians living abroad. Most visitors are drawn to the resorts that occupy a stretch of the Atlantic coast.<br><br>Gambia has been relatively stable under the iron-fisted rule of Yahya Jammeh, who came to power in a bloodless coup in 1994.

It is about 41 kilometres (25 mi) long, and between 6 and 12 kilometres (4-7.5 mi) wide, with a total area of 360 square kilometres (140 sq mi). <br><br>The territory takes its name from Gaza, its main city.\r\nThe population is about 1.6 million people, most of them descendants of refugees. One million of the population, as of March 2005, were considered refugees, although the vast majority of them were actually born in the Gaza Strip; the older generation fled to Gaza in 1948 as part of the 1948 Palestinian exodus following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, from some parts of Mandate Palestine that became Israel. The population is predominantly Sunni Muslim. With a yearly growth rate of about 3.2%, the Gaza strip has the 7th highest population growth rate in the world.\r\n<br><br>The Gaza Strip acquired its current boundaries at the cessation of fighting in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, which was confirmed in the Israel-Egypt Armistice Agreement on 24 February 1949. Article V of the Agreement declared that the demarcation line was not to be an international border. The Gaza Strip continued to be occupied by Egypt. At first it administered the territory through the All-Palestine Government and then directly from 1959 until 1967, when Israel occupied it following the Six-Day War. Pursuant to the Oslo Accords signed between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization in 1993, the Palestinian Authority was set up as an interim administrative body to govern Palestinian population centres, with Israel maintaining control of Gaza Strip's airspace, all but one of its land borders and territorial waters, until a final agreement could be reached. As agreement remained elusive, Israel unilaterally disengaged from Gaza in 2005.\r\n<br><br>The Gaza Strip is one of the territorial units forming the Palestinian territories. Since July 2007, following the 2006 Palestinian legislative election and the Battle of Gaza, Hamas has functioned as the effective government in the Gaza Strip.\r\nIsrael evacuated its settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005 and withdrew its forces, ending almost four decades of military occupation. However, after the militant Islamic group Hamas seized control of Gaza in June 2007, Israel intensified its economic blockade of the Strip.\r\nDespite the handover of Gaza and parts of the West Bank to Palestinian control, a \"final status\" agreement has yet to be reached. The main stumbling blocks include the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements.",

      "countryOverview": "Georgia is a sovereign state in the Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located at the crossroads of Western Asia and Eastern Europe, it is bounded to the west by the Black Sea, to the north by Russia, to the south-west by Turkey, to the south by Armenia, and to the south-east by Azerbaijan. <br><br>Georgia has a population of almost 4.7 million. Georgia's constitution is that of a representative democracy, organised as a unitary, semi-presidential republic. It is currently a member of the United Nations. The country aspires to join the North-Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the European Union.\r\nThe history of Georgia can be traced back to the ancient kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia. It was one of the first countries to adopt Christianity, in the early 4th century. <br><br>Georgia reached the peak of its political and economic strength during the reign of King David IV and Queen Tamar in the 11th and 12th centuries. At the beginning of the 19th century, Georgia was annexed by the Russian Empire. After a brief period of independence following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Georgia was annexed by Soviet Russia in 1921 and from 1922 to 1991 the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR) was one of the fifteen federal republics of the Soviet Union. Like many post-communist countries, Georgia suffered from civil unrest and economic crisis for most of the 1990s through the Rose Revolution of 2003, after which the new government introduced democratic and economic reforms.\r\nIncreasing US economic and political influence in the country has long been a source of concern for the Kremlin, as have Georgia's aspirations to join NATO and the EU.\r\n<br><br>Tensions between Moscow and Tbilisi are never far from the surface and in August 2008 flared up into an armed conflict triggered by clashes between Georgian troops and South Ossetian separatist forces.\r\nSince independence, the people of Georgia have endured periods of civil war and unrest as well as violence related to the independence aspirations of the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Both regions had close ties with Moscow, which in August 2008 announced it was formally recognising their independence.\r\nRussian troops had operated there since the early 1990s, and were regularly accused by Georgia of siding with the separatists.\r\n<br><br>Georgia contains two de facto independent regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which gained limited international recognition after the 2008 South Ossetia war between Georgia and Russia. Georgia still considers the regions to be of their sovereign territory.<br><br>President Mikhail Saakashvili The president of Georgia is&nbsp;Mikhail Saakashvili, who won a second term in office in 2008. He first came to power in the \"Rose Revolution\" in 2003. Foreign investment and economic reform have both driven growth in Georgia, with the agriculture being the key-sector. Georgia has ambitions to join NATO and it currently has troops in Afghanistan.",
